\paragraph{To the reader:} These are my lecture notes for Python for Data Analysis, which I consider a work in progress. They're not written to replace class attendance, so you might not find them self-contained. These notes rely on three books,
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{\link{https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Gaddis-Starting-Out-with-Python-Plus-My-Lab-Programming-with-Pearson-e-Text-Access-Card-Package-4th-Edition/PGM335157.html}{Starting out with Python}} by Tony Gaddis
    \item \textit{\link{https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/}{Python for Data Analysis}} by Wes McKinney
    \item \textit{\link{https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/}{Python Data Science Handbook}} by Jake VanderPlas.
\end{itemize}
There are many other fantastic books and resources for self-studying Python. I encourage you to find as many supplementary sources as you find helpful, but to return to these notes to help focus on what will be important for doing well on assignments and exams in this course.
